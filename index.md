My name is John T. Foster, Jr., I’m an assistant professor in the Departments of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering and Aerospace Engineering and Engineering Mechanics at the University of Texas at Austin.  <!--Before joining UT, I was previously a faculty member in mechanical engineering at UTSA and was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories where I worked for 7 years.-->  I received my BS and MS in mechanical engineering from Texas Tech University and PhD from Purdue University. I am a registered Professional Engineer in the State of Texas.  During my career in research I have been involved in many projects ranging from full scale projectile penetration field tests, to laboratory experiments using Kolsky bars, to modeling and simulation efforts using some of the world’s largest computers. My research interests are in experimental and computational mechanics and multi-scale modeling with applications to geomechanics, impact mechanics, fracture mechanics, and anamolous transport processes. Additionally, I have interest in fundamental theoretical advancement of the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics.  My teaching interests are in all areas of theoretical and computational mechanics.
