## Welcome!

My name is John T. Foster, I’m an Assistant Professor of Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering at the University of Texas at Austin.  Before joining UT-PGE, I was previously a faculty member in mechanical engineering at UTSA and was a Senior Member of the Technical Staff at Sandia National Laboratories where I worked for 7 years.  I received my BS and MS in Mechanical Engineering from Texas Tech University and his PhD from Purdue University. During my career in research I have been involved in many projects ranging from full scale projectile penetration field tests, to laboratory experiments using Kolsky bars, to modeling and simulation efforts using some of the world’s largest computers. My research interest include impact and damage mechanics, dynamic behavior of materials and dynamic fracture, computational mechanics, and the peridynamic theory of solid mechanics.  My teaching interests are in the areas of theoretical and computational mechanics. Please refer to my current <a href="/cv/">CV</a> for more details.
